# Buttons

Three button variants are available:

- flat button;
- raised button;
- text button.

Each button variant supports semantic colours defined in the Agye UI library:

- primary;
- secondary;
- warn;
- inherit.

Button components can render any valid HTML as their label, just like the regular `<button>` tag in HTML.
